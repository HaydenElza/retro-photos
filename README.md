## Installation
You'll need the Python [Pillow library](https://python-pillow.org/) to run the script. I suggest using a Conda environment. For example, you can create a Conda environment by running the following in the project directory:
```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Then activate the environment using:
```bash
conda activate retro_photos
```

## Run

Before running the script add photos to `photos/` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Photos are sorted by number.

Then run `app.py`:
```bash
python app.py
```

The photos should be placed in a directory called `output/` in the project directory.
